## Treatzbook 
### Objective 
With Treatzbook, patients may schedule doctor's appointment online in real time, all from the comfort of their own homes. In situations like pandemics, when it is unsafe and unsuitable for patients and others to go from hospital to hospital, this idea could literally save lives. 
The major goal of our project is to simplify the appointment process as much as possible. With its easy-to-use design, consumers can quickly make appointments and locate the closest providers.
The following are the main services provided by our application: 
1. Easy bookings 
2. Find Doctors nearby 
3. Real time bookings
